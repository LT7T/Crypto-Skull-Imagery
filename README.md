# Crypto-Skull-Imagery

This repo contains CryptoSkulls 0-9999 NFT Images with backgrounds and with backgrounds removed and replaced with transaprency.

Coming Soon:
 - Python script to pull all of the original SKull images with backgrounds from the Crypto Skull API.
 - All related NFT metadata, including game token metadata
 - Extended metadata that identifies the properties as what they actually are instead of numbers.
 - Rarity App to provide the ability to check the rarity of each skull across the multiple chains and releases.
